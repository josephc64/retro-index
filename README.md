# Retro Index
This is a collection of various resources useful for playing through games, both on official hardware or emulators. It includes complete save files for primarily multiplayer games containing useful unlocks and pre-configured settings, play order resources, and more.

These apply mostly to USA versions of the games, and there are no ROMs included here.

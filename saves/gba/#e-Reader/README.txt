Make sure you have at least mGBA 0.7-WIP or newer installed (currently you need to install/update mGBA from source using RetroPie 4.4.1). 
You need to extract the save file for the game you want to play and place it wherever your saves go, named correctly.
Just find a copy of "e-Reader (USA).gba" and copy it, renaming it each time so it matches the save files name.

Example:
"e-Reader (USA).gba" renamed to:
"Mario Party-e - 01 - Cast Away Mario! (U) (e-Reader).gba"
So it matches:
"Mario Party-e - 01 - Cast Away Mario! (U) (e-Reader).srm"

You can do this for all of the save files if you want to play these Mario Party-e mini-games.
